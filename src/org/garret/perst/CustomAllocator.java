/**
 * Custom allocator interface. Custom allocator can be used for more efficiently 
 * allocate space using application specific semantic of the object. For example,
 * application can place all BLOBs (images, texts, video,...) in separate file, located at separate disk
 * and keep file with the rest of the data (metadata describing this BLOBs) relatively small, improving
 * speed of search operations. Such separation of BLOBs and their descriptors can be achieved
 * using custom allocator in conjunction with multifile. First segment is used for allocation of normal
 * (non-BLOB) objects. It's size can be set practically unlimited: 0x1000 0000 0000 0000.
 * And second segment should be used by custom allocator to allocate BLOBs. So BLOBs offsets are started
 * from 0x1000000000000000 and BLOB content will be stored in separate file which in turn can be located 
 * at separate disk.
