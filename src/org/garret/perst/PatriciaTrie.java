 * PATRICIA trie (Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded In Alphanumeric).
 * Tries are a kind of tree where each node holds a common part of one or more keys. 
 * PATRICIA trie is one of the many existing variants of the trie, which adds path compression 
 * by grouping common sequences of nodes together.<BR>
 * This structure provides a very efficient way of storing values while maintaining the lookup time 
 * for a key in O(N) in the worst case, where N is the length of the longest key. 
 * This structure has it's main use in IP routing software, but can provide an interesting alternative 
 * to other structures such as hashtables when memory space is of concern.
